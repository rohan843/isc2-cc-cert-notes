## Security Principles

### The CIA Triad

This triad is composed of 3 key terms: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is so-created to make important components of security sound relevant to non - technical people.

**Confidentiality**: Providing authorized access to information, and preventing its improper disclosure.

**Integrity**: A property of information, where it is kept and used in a way that it is accurate, complete, internally consistent, and useful.

**Availability**: Systems and data must be available when the users need them.

### Privacy

**It is the right of an individual to control the distribution of information about themselves.** Privacy is different from security, even though both focus on safeguarding information.

The legislation and regulations on privacy and data can affect organizations _irrespective of their physical location_.

There is a major push towards privacy legislation and compliance with existing policies. There are various laws defining privacy and data protection, which periodically change.

Merely ensuring proper security measures are in place is not enough for organizations to meet privacy regulations. **They are still liable for any mishandling or misuse of data.**

#### GDPR: General Data Protection Legislation

The EU passed this legislation in 2018, deeming privacy to be an individual human right. **GDPR applies to all organizations and individuals doing business in EU.** EU member countries and other jurisdictions such as several states in the US enact laws to enforce privacy regulations. For the EU countries, these laws may be more stringent than GDPR.

Any entity anywhere must abide by the legal requirements of its jurisdiction. It is important to properly assess how these laws apply to our organizations.

### Risk Management

The level of cybersecurity involved depends on the amount of risk that an entity is willing to accept.

**Risk refers to the potential consequences of what happens in our environment.**

We evaluate risk, and then **implement security controls to help mitigate the risk to an _acceptable level_**.

Risks can vary from malware, social engineering, denial of service attacks, fires, crimes, natural disasters, etc.

Risk can be broadly categorized based on probability of occurrence and severity of impact, giving us 4 categories:

| High probability, low impact | High probability, high impact |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Low probability, low impact  | Low probability, high impact  |

### Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Likelihood
