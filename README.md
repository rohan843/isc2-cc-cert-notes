## Security Principles

### The CIA Triad

This triad is composed of 3 key terms: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is so-created to make important components of security sound relevant to non - technical people.

**Confidentiality**: Providing authorized access to information, and preventing its improper disclosure.

**Integrity**: A property of information, where it is kept and used in a way that it is accurate, complete, internally consistent, and useful.

**Availability**: Systems and data must be available when the users need them.

### Privacy

**It is the right of an individual to control the distribution of information about themselves.** Privacy is different from security, even though both focus on safeguarding information.

The legislation and regulations on privacy and data can affect organizations _irrespective of their physical location_.

There is a major push towards privacy legislation and compliance with existing policies. There are various laws defining privacy and data protection, which periodically change.

Merely ensuring proper security measures are in place is not enough for organizations to meet privacy regulations. They are still liable for any mishandling or misuse of data.
