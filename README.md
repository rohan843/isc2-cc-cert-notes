## Security Principles

### The CIA Triad

This triad is composed of 3 key terms: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is so-created to make important components of security sound relevant to non - technical people.

**Confidentiality**: Providing authorized access to information, and preventing its improper disclosure.

**Integrity**: A property of information, where it is kept and used in a way that it is accurate, complete, internally consistent, and useful.
